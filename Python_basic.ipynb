        "Answer-1. Python is an easy- to- learn yet powerful object-oriented programming language. It is a very high-level programming language\n",
        "It is popular for-:\n",
        "Easy to use, expressive language, interpreted language, free & open source, its completeness, cross platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question-2. What is an interpreter in Python. **\n",
        "Answer-2. In python, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes python code line by line. It handles everything from reading and understanding your code to actually executing it on your machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question-3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python**.\n",
        "Answer-3. Predefined keywords in python (reserved words) are special words that have come specific meanings and purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question-4. Can keywords be used as variable names**.\n",
        "Answer-4. No, we cannot use them as variable names, function names or identifiers because they are part of the python syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question-5. What is mutability in Python.**\n",
        "Answer-5. Mutability refers to the ability of an object or data structure to change its state, value, or contents after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question- 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable**.\n",
        "Answer-6.  LIST- These are mutable means you can change the contents (add, remove, etc) without changing the object’s identity.\n",
        "                 TUPLE- These are immutable means once created, the contents cannot be changed.\n",
        "              LIST – lists are designed to hold a sequence of items that may change overtime.\n",
        "          L1= [ 1,2,3]\n",
        "         L1 [0] = 12 # Allowed\n",
        "          TUPLE - Tuple are intended for fixed collections of items like data base records, coordinates etc.\n",

        "**is (Identity operators)**\n",

        "•\tReturns true if the variables point to same memory location, false………\n",
        "•\tUsed to check if two variables refer to the exact same object.\n",

        "Answer-8. In python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statement and returns Boolean values (True or False).\n",
        "    3 main logical operators are: -\n",
        "1.\tAnd - Returns true if both statements are true\n",
        "5>2 and 5<10 #True.\n",
        "2.\tOr - Returns true if at least one of the statements is true\n",
        "                        5<3 or 5>2 #True\n",
        "3.\tNot - Returns the result, returns False if the result is true\n",

        "**Queston-9. What is type casting in Python.**\n",
        "Answer-9. Type casting in python refers to converting a variable from one data type to another. This is useful when you want to perform operations that require a specific data type.\n",
        " For example converting a string to a number for calculations.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Question-10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting**.\n",
        "Answer-10. The purpose of conditional statement is to allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables or the result of comparisons.\n",

        "**Question-11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python.**\n",
        "Answer-11. conditional statements in Python is to allow your program to make decisions and execute different code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question-12. How does the elif statement work.**\n",
        "Answer-12. The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\". It is used to check multiple conditions one after another. It only runs if all previous if and elif conditions were false, and its own condition is true.\n",
